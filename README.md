# SwiftfulCrypto

This is an iOS cryptocurrency tracking app project created using RESTful API's, MVVM architecture, and SwiftUI as part of the SwiftUI Crypto App Series by SwiftfulThinking on YouTube.

## Project

This project is a practical implementation of the concepts taught in the tutorial series, which focuses on using SwiftUI and MVVM architecture to build a cryptocurrency tracking application.

## Skills Learned

In the process of creating this project, I acquired the following skills and knowledge:

- Creating an iOS app with SwiftUI using MVVM architecture
- Integrating cryptocurrency data using external APIs
- Designing custom user interfaces for a visually appealing user experience
- Adapting the app for various device sizes, orientations, and Dark Mode

- ## Using RESTful APIs

This project relies on RESTful APIs to retrieve cryptocurrency data and display it within the app. The following key aspects are involved in using external APIs:

- API Integration: The project demonstrates how to integrate external RESTful APIs into your SwiftUI application. It covers topics such as making HTTP requests, handling responses, and parsing JSON data.

- Cryptocurrency Data: The app fetches real-time cryptocurrency data, including prices, market capitalization, and historical trends, from external sources. It showcases how to consume data from RESTful endpoints and use it to populate your app's user interface.

- Error Handling: The project includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle scenarios like network errors or API rate limits. It ensures a smooth user experience even when external data sources are temporarily unavailable.
